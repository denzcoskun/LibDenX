Android base structure project. With this library you can write less code and develop faster.

### First use BaseActivity

BaseActivity include **onViewReady** and **getLayoutResourceId** functions. 

**onViewReady** works like onCreate. You can write your code here and you can use instead of onCreate.
**getLayoutResourceId** is used to link the class with the layout like setContentView. Actually BaseActivity uses setContentView in background.

You can use with **ButterKnife**.
```java
public class MainActivity extends BaseActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onViewReady(Bundle savedInstanceState, Intent intent) {
        super.onViewReady(savedInstanceState, intent);
    }

    @Override
    protected int getLayoutResourceId() {
        return R.layout.activity_main;
    }
}
```
#### You can add back button:
```java
addBackButton();
```
#### Volley Object Request:
```java
getJsonObject("Your Url", YourModel.class, result -> {
     //result is your response model. You can use here.       
});
 ```
#### Volley Array Request:
```java
getJsonArray("Your Url", result -> {
    // result is your response array. You can use here.
 });
 ```
 #### Check Internet Connection:
 ```java
  isNetworkConnected();
 ```
#### Show Toast Message:
```java
showMessage(int Message);
//or
showMessage(String Message);
 ```
